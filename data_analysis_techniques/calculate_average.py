# Prog05: Create a program that ask user to input a number, 
# continue asking until the user input is invalid. Display the average.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 1: Planning

# - Objective: I will create a program that asks for numbers until invalid input and displays the average.
# - Scope: Continuous user input and average calculation.
# - Resources: Python

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 2: Requirements Gathering/Analysis

# - Requirements:
#     - Accept numerical inputs from user until invalid input
#     - Store all valid inputs
#     - Calculate the arithmetic mean (average)
#     - Display the average at the end
#     - Terminate on invalid input

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 3: Design

# - Algorithm (input, process, output):
#     1. Initialize
#        1.1. Print a message instructing the user to enter numbers
#        1.2. Create an empty `list` to store entered numbers
#     2. Start an infinite loop to continuously get user input
#        2.1. Try to:
#           2.1.1. Read user input and convert it to a float
#           2.1.2. Add the number to the `list`
#        2.2. If a non-numeric input is entered:
#           2.2.1. Print "Invalid input. Program terminated."
#           2.2.2. Break the loop
#     3. Check if at least one number was entered
#        3.1. If numbers exist:
#           3.1.1. Compute the average: `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`
#           3.1.2. PPrint the calculated average
#        3.2. Otherwise, print "No valid numbers were entered."

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 4: Implementation/Development

# Ask user for inputs until a non-number is entered
print("Enter numbers (enter a non-number to stop):")

# Create an empty list to store entered numbers
numbers = []

# Start an infinite loop to continuously get user input
while True:
    try:
        # Get input from the user and convert it to a float
        num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

        # Add the valid number to the list
        numbers.append(num)

    except ValueError:
        # Handle non-numeric input and terminate the program
        print("Invalid input. Program terminated.")
        break

# Check if at least one valid number was entered
if numbers:
    # Calculate the average by summing the numbers and dividing by the count
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    # Display the calculated average
    print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
else:
    # Handle case where no valid numbers were entered
    print("No valid numbers were entered.")

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 5: Testing

# Test Case 1: All same numbers -> Should display that number
# Test Case 2: Mix of positive and negative -> Should calculate correct average
# Test Case 3: Numbers that average to zero -> Should display 0
# Test Case 4: No inputs (immediate invalid) -> Should display message
# Test Case 5: Decimal inputs -> Should calculate correct average

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 6: Deployment

# Program is ready for use and can be executed as part of the batch 4

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 7: Maintenance & Support

# Iâ€™d be grateful for any feedback, suggestions, or ideas to help improve things :)
